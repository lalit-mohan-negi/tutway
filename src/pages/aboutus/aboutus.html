   <h3>Welcome to Tutway, a unique platform where learning is fun.</h3>
   <p>Now there is no distinction between kids fun time and study time... 
    Say goodbye to the days of cramming those dull and ponderous books which made learning a tedious task. At Tutway, we believe in a very simple idea, that audio-visual learning is the most effective tool for learning. Many researchers have proven that kids learn a lot by playing the interactive games and watching audio-visual animated lessons as compared to reading from books. To learn the new concepts, Kids show more interest in adopting unique ways of learning. We have brought programme that not only covers the important concepts but also makes learning more stable that stimulates the critical thinking of the young learners. 
    
    Let's break away from our perception that adopting new learning concepts is difficult and challenging. You will find out our website very user-friendly and an interactive mode of gaining knowledge. Even kids can access the content without constant parental supervision. 
    
    The human race has come a long way from where it started in terms of the technological advancements. Every new invention once seemed impossibility. Have you ever realized that technology has changed a lot in last century?... 
    Imagine a phone 100 years ago... And that's it turns up now... 
    Imagine railways 100 years ago... And that's these look like now... 
    Imagine an airplane 100 years ago and that's it looks like now... 
    Imagine a class room 100 years ago... And that's it appears now... 
    
    But shockingly, classrooms have not changed much. We still rely on rote learning and have those classrooms where all the students are expected to learn together irrespective of their different aptitudes and learning abilities. Consequently, they forget most of the concepts after some time and the root cause is to cram the bookish language. That's when Tutway comes to the rescue. It is a supplementary education programme, where kids can learn at their own pace. The students can watch animated videos, which are so meticulously made that they can understand even the most complex concepts very easily. There is a question bank at the end of each video where they can answer those questions multiple times and test whether they have received the knowledge optimally or not. It's fun and rewarding at the same time. And to encourage the students to learn we have a policy of 'The more you learn, the more you earn'. Under this policy, when you learn more and get good marks in the quizzes, you will be rewarded with stars, which can be spent by kids on buying toys or even movie tickets right from the Tutway website. Moreover, with information systems embedded in the programme, parents can monitor real time performance of their kids and get up-to-date information about their performance including quizzes attempted and marks scored in each quiz, both in tabular and graphical formats. Regular reports are e-mailed to parents so that the parents can analyze their kids' performance. 
    
    We all know that in order to build a building we need a strong solid foundation. Similarly, if we want to understand high-level concepts, we should have a clear understanding of basic concepts. 
    
    For instance, if kids don't know about addition and subtraction, they cannot do multiplication; and if they don't know about multiplication, they cannot do division. And if they don't have the knowledge of these four basic operations, algebra cannot be done by them; and it goes on and on. 
    
    Same applies to English language. If kids don't have sound knowledge of grammar and vocabulary, it becomes extremely difficult for them to have good communication skills. 
    
    Knowledge of the scientific concepts is also required for observing physical, chemical and biological phenomena's all around us. 
    
    That's why, Tutway has hundreds of animated videos on Maths, English, and Science to clear the core basics of these subjects. It perfectly suits most of the educational needs of most of the students regardless of their learning ability.
